//ATM Withdrawal Simulation. (Follow Below Steps to Write Program)
//       Steps to Write the Program
//1️⃣ Initialize the account balance with a fixed amount (e.g., ₹10,000).
//2️⃣ Take user input for the amount they want to withdraw.
//3️⃣ Check withdrawal conditions:
//The amount should be greater than zero.
//The amount should be a multiple of 100 (common ATM rule).
//The amount should not exceed the account balance.
//4️⃣ Deduct the amount from the balance if conditions are met.
//5️⃣ Display the updated balance or an error message if the withdrawal fails.
